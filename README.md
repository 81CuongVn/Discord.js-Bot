## (OPTIONAL) Keeping your bot online on a virtual private server
Want to start hosting your own bot? Well I have one recommended tool for youuuuuuuuuu :D

As mentioned in optional tools, PM2 is a useful tool that can help you keep your bot online and restart it whenever it crashes. To install it do
`npm i pm2` to install it for the repo only or do `npm i pm2 -g` to install it globally (need admin/sudo perms)

Then you can start the bot using PM2 by doing `pm2 start index.js` inside the bot folder. More documentation [here](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/)
